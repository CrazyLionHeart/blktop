Idea for gen2 blktop is somehow split messy code in gen1 to few separate entity:

* Engine for math:
	- calculate averages for last second, min/max/avg for more extended interval
	- calculate derivatives values (like latency and so on)
	- calculate group statistic
* Data gathering
	- device enumeration
	- mostly from /sys/block/*/stat
	- updating device list in realtime
	- filter out some devices based on config
	- data relationship
	- grouping based on real relationship or supplied from configuration file
* Visualization
	- Adopting to screen of different sizes
	- highlighting unusual
	- sorting data based on supplied fields considering groups
* Time and keyboard control
	- periodic updates with fixed ratio
	- accepts input from user
	- check for screen size changes
	- ask for new device discovery
